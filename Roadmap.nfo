Our Roadmap for the launcher so far:

Current Release: 0.7.1 Silvia Release Candidate 1, confirmed to be stable and ready to ship.
                     v
Next Release: 0.8 SilEighty
This release will include a toggle option for ThirteenAG's Widescreen fix.
However, we will need to get their permission if we want to include the fix files with the launcher.
