###Need for Speed Most Wanted Launcher for UNIX-Like Operating Systems

##Description:

This project aims to provide a simple launcher to run NFS: MW on UNIX-Like operating systems. It is part of the NFS: MW 1.4 
and 2.0 Community Patch but a version for 1.2/1.3 users is available seperately. It has only been tested so far on Linux but 
a Mac version is in progress. Currently it is a CLI-only tool but a GUI version is being planned. Any help with this project 
is beneficial. The Launcher works best with the R.G. Mechanics version of MW.

##Installation instuctions:

1. Install MW in PlayOnLinux. Call your executable shortcut 'speed' (without the inverted commas).
2. Install Arushan's MW Mod Loader. Leave all the settings to the default for now.
3. Assuming you've extracted the Launcher executable to your Documents directory, 
open a terminal and type this command (without the inverted commas): 'cd ~/Documents && chmod +x MW_Launcher_Redist.sh'.
4. Type ./MW_Launcher_Redist.sh to run.
5. Enjoy! Contact me at http://txti.es/linuxfanatic1 if you have any issues.
