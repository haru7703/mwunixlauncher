###Need for Speed Most Wanted Launcher for UNIX-Like Operating Systems

This project aims to provide a simple launcher to run NFS: MW on UNIX-Like operating systems. It is part of the NFS: MW 1.4 
and 2.0 Community Patch but a version for 1.2/1.3 users is available seperately. It has only been tested so far on Linux but 
a Mac version is in progress. Currently it is a CLI-only tool but a GUI version is being planned. Any help with this project 
is beneficial. The Launcher works best with the R.G. Mechanics version of MW.

Please see mwunixlauncher/0_7_Silvia/Readme_0_7_2.nfo for the installation instructions. If you need help running the Launcher
or have a recommendation/query, contact me at http://txti.es/linuxfanatic1.
